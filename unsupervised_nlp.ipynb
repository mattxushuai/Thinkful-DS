Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",

      "6 \" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ,\" replied Emma , smiling ; \" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time  and not very distant either  when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?\"\n",
      "7 \" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so .\"\n",
